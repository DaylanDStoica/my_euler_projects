Coin sums

Project Euler
Problem 31

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). 
There are eight coins in general circulation:

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1*£1 + 1*50p + 2*20p + 1*5p + 1*2p + 3*1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

def develop_path():
    '''create a list of values corresponding to the value of coins
    equal to 200p'''
    return []

potential_coins = [ 1, 2, 5, 20, 50, 100] # 2 pounds equals 200 units
